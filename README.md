# UnityTilemapGuide
My guide to both understanding and using Unity Tilemaps

Current Unity Version : 2020.3.23f1


## Tilemap Serialization
Save/Load Unity Tilemaps with JSON! 

This makes use of Odin Serializer (https://github.com/TeamSirenix/odin-serializer)

Open SerializationDemo in Unity Editor to test.

## Tilemap Field of View

This allows you to make create/modify Tilemaps as you wish and not worry about how Field of View will be affected.

This uses the ShadowCast algorithm provided by Adam Milazzo (http://www.adammil.net/blog/v125_Roguelike_Vision_Algorithms.html#shadowcode)

Open FieldOfViewDemo in Unity Editor to test.
